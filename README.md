## For themes built using SASS/SCSS

1. Download a zip folder/clone a repository.
2. Copy the `scss` directory and paste it to the sass/scss directory of the theme styles.
3. Import `style.scss` at the end of the main file containing styles.
4. Have fun!

## For themes built without SASS/SCSS

1. Download a zip folder/clone a repository.
2. Run a console command `npm i`.
3. Run a console command `npm run watch` (this will run a task that will watch for changes in .scss files).
4. Add generated `style.css` to your theme.
5. Have fun!

## Useful theme support snippets

### Enqueuing the style to your theme

Add the following snippet into `functions.php`:

```
wp_enqueue_style( 'mphb-style-kit', 'path_to_compiled_style/style.css', array(), '1.0.0' );
```

### Enqueuing the style to Block Editor

If you are using default Block Editor, and want load styles there - then add the following snippet into `functions.php`:

```
add_theme_support('editor-styles');

add_editor_style( array(
    'path_to_compiled_style/style.css',
    /* here can be url to Google Font, or another style file */
) );
```

## Directory structure
For your convenience, all styles are logically divided into files. All files contain templates with the minimum set of selectors for styling different blocks.

```
mphb-style-kit
â”œâ”€â”€â”€css                     # compiled css will be here
â””â”€â”€â”€scss
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€shortcodes          # shortcode-related styles
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€_accommodations-list.scss
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€ ...
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€_single-accommodation.scss
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€_accommodations-attributes.scss
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€ _single-service.scss
    â””â”€â”€â”€style.scss          # main general style file
```
